A joystick functions by converting the manual displacement of a lever into digital signals that computers can interpret.

For comprehensive motion tracking, the joystick captures the lever's displacement across two perpendicular planes: the horizontal X-axis and the vertical Y-axis. Utilizing the principles of Cartesian coordinates, these axes work in tandem to define the lever's precise location.

The joystick's mechanism assesses the lever's placement by tracking the shafts' orientation. Traditional analog joysticks achieve this through the use of potentiometers, which are adjustable resistors that provide variable output based on their position.

Additionally, the joystick is equipped with a digital button that triggers input when it is depressed, offering an additional layer of interaction with the computer system.

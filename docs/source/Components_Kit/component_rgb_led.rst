RGB LEDs can emit light in a range of colors. They combine three LEDs—red, green, and blue—within a single transparent or semitransparent plastic casing. By adjusting the input voltage to each of the three pins, you can mix these colors to produce a wide spectrum of hues. According to statistics, this allows for the creation of up to 16,777,216 different colors.

RGB LEDs are available in two main types: common anode and common cathode. This kit includes the common cathode type. In a **common cathode** (CC) configuration, the cathodes of the three LEDs are connected together. When you connect this shared cathode to GND and apply voltage to the three individual pins, the LED will emit the corresponding colors.

Its circuit symbol is shown as figure.

An RGB LED has 4 pins: the longest one is GND; the others are Red, Green and Blue. Touch its plastic shell and you will find a cut. The pin closest to the cut is the first pin, marked as Red, then GND, Green and Blue in turn.

Photoresistor is simply a light sensitive resistor. It is an active component that decreases resistance with respect to receiving luminosity (light) on the component's light sensitive surface. Photoresistorâ€™s resistance value will change in proportion to the ambient light detected. With this characteristic, we can use a Photoresistor to detect light intensity. The Photoresistor and its electronic symbol are as follows.
